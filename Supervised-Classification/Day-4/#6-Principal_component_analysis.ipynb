    "__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensions are nothing but features that represent the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, A 28 X 28 image has 784 picture elements (pixels) that are the dimensions or features which together represent that image.\n",
    "__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### One important thing to note about PCA is that it is an Unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You can cluster the similar data points based on the feature correlation between them without any supervision (or labels)\n",
